# The-Maximum-Flow-Problem-Dinitz-s-Algorithm
This project is a product of the Academic excellence program of my college and algorithms course. 

About: 
Investigation of the "Maximum Flow Problem" and Dinitz's Algorithm to find the maximum flow in flow networks.
Dinitz's algorithm is a non-trivial improvement of the Ford-Fulkerson's algorithm.
I am required to analyze and explain the correctness of the algorithm,
make a theoretical comparison with other algorithms in that field 
(Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp) and to make a practical comparison between them.

The practical comparison consists of two stages:
1. Implement the algorithms and their data structures in C. 
2. Build different realistic flow-networks in Java.
